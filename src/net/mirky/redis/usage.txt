usage: redis -[ilxrth] filename.suf

 -i, --identify       show data identifying this file
                      (recursively if container file)

 -x, --extract        extract files from a given image
 -r, --reconstruct    reconstruct original image from the rcn and
                      extracted files
 -t, --test           attempt reconstruction but don't rewrite
                      the image
 -h, --hexdump        hexdump the image's content
 --format=SPEC        treat the given file as an object of this format

 --version            print version data

The following reflective operations are mainly useful for diagnostics.
 --dump-lang          dump the content of disassembly table given
                      in parameter
 --dump-decoding      dump the content of the decoding table given
                      in parameter                      
 --list-simple-types  list known simple (that is, single-valued) option
                      types
 
PLEASE NOTE: redis' attempts to deduce file format based on
not just magic header (which is not found in many old formats)
but also its name.
