User-visible changes:
* declared bin as an alias of binary
* changed the canonical name for the CP/M API format option to "cpm"
* implemented the --dump-decoding and --show-decoding diagnostic command line
  options
* don't show stacktrace for command line parse errors
* added the 'koi7' decoding
* added the 'blocks' format
* added the 'geometry' option type as single-valued
* the 'd64-directory' display is now more streamlined

Programmer-visible changes:
* introduced TextResource.Missing, an unchecked exception, thrown when opening
  a resource file fails
* implemented the @ArgCountLimits annotation
* introduced Hex.n() for nybbles
* documented Format.EntryPoint
* refactored Format.Option.EntryPointIterator into Format.Option.ArrayIterator
* extracted Format.EntryPoint.stringify() from Format.OptionType.ENTRY.stringify()
* extracted Format.EntryPoint.parse() from Format.OptionType.ENTRY.parse()
* introduced TextResource.getStream() and TextResource.getBufferedReader()
* introduced Disassembler.LangSequencer.setCountdown()
* obsoleted the two-parameter form of Disassembler.LangSequencer.switchTemporarily()
* introduced several forms of the set-countdown tabular lang opcode
* constructed a basic text-backed resource management system as ResourceManager:
  * decodings, API:s, and languages are now in resources rather than hardcoded
    * introduced Disassembler.SequencerEffect and its implementations
    * replaced Disassembler.API.affectSequencer() by getSequencerEffect()
  * instead of Decoding.get() returning null for unknown decodings,
    Decoding.MANAGER.get() will now throw ResourceManager.ResolutionFailure
  * renamed the 'dits' directory to 'resources'
  * moved *.decoding into the new 'resources' directory
  * renamed *.dit into *.lang
  * implemented the Default-countdown: and Trivial! lang declaration to replace
    the previously hardcoded attributes
  * the list of referred languages of a tabular language (for dispatch or
    tempswitch) is now automatically managed, no longer hardcoded
  * replaced the counted tempswitch tabular lang opcodes with the implicitly
    counted version followed by an appropriate set-countdown opcode
* fixed a bug in Format.deparen()'s handling of the "(foo)bar(baz)" case.
* show lang metdata in a tabular language dump
* restructured D64DirectoryAnalyser to serve as basis for the new customisable
  data structure dumper
* introduced Struct, StructFieldType, and IntegerSliceType together with
  several implementations
* converted zxsbaskw.tab into a Saguaro-inspired format and updated
  ZXSBasicProgrmaCodeAnalyser.loadStringTable() accordingly
* converted suffixen.txt into a Saguaro-inspired format and replaced
  Main.loadMultiAssocResource() by Saguaro.loadStringMultimap()
* refactored usage() and loadFilesizes() to read a BufferedReader directly
  rather than through TextResource.LineIterator
* removed now-obsolete TextResource.LineIterator and converted TextResource
  from class into a module
* introduced ParseUtil
* entry vectors in *.api are now parsed as ordinary numbers and thus require 0x
  prefix when in hex
