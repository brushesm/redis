User-visible changes:
* declared bin as an alias of binary
* changed the canonical name for the CP/M API format option to "cpm"
* implemented the --dump-decoding and --show-decoding diagnostic command line
  options
* don't show stacktrace for command line parse errors
* added the 'koi7' decoding
* added the 'blocks' format

Programmer-visible changes:
* implemented a parser for decodings represented in text resources
* converted the previously hardcoded decodings (ascii, folded-ascii,
  latin-1, zx-spectrum, petscii) into text resources
* Decoding.get() now throws Decoding.ResolutionError rather than returning null
* TextResource.LineIterator() now throws TextResource.Missing, an unchecked
  exception, when opening the resource fails
* replaced the fully hardcoded decoding map with a cache backed by decoding
  resources so new decodings will be easier to add in the future
* implemented the @ArgCountLimits annotation
* introduced Hex.n() for nybbles
* documented Format.EntryPoint
* refactored Format.Option.EntryPointIterator into Format.Option.ArrayIterator
* extracted Format.EntryPoint.stringify() from Format.OptionType.ENTRY.stringify()
